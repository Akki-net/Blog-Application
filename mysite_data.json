    "body": "Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist who defied British rule in India and sought foreign allies to liberate his country.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1897 in Bengal, a province that was often at the forefront of the Indian freedom struggle. He was educated in India and England and joined the Indian civil service, but soon resigned to join the Congress party led by Gandhi.\r\n\r\nBose became a prominent leader of the Congress and was elected its president twice, but he clashed with Gandhi over the methods and goals of the independence movement. He advocated for a more militant and socialist approach, while Gandhi favoured non-violence and cooperation with the British.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Bose escaped from house arrest and made his way to Germany, where he hoped to enlist the support of Hitler for his cause. He formed the Indian Legion, a unit of Indian soldiers who had been captured by the Nazis in North Africa.\r\n\r\nHe also established the Azad Hind Radio, which broadcasted his speeches and propaganda to India and the world. He called himself Netaji, meaning respected leader, and urged Indians to rise up against the British colonialists.\r\n\r\nIn 1943, Bose left Germany and travelled to Japan, where he took command of the Indian National Army, or INA, a force of Indian prisoners of war and civilians who had joined the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nHe declared the formation of a provisional government of free India in Singapore and led the INA in a campaign to reach Delhi, the capital of India. However, his army faced heavy resistance from the British and their allies and was eventually forced to retreat.\r\n\r\nBose died in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945, shortly after Japan surrendered. His death remains a mystery and a source of controversy for many Indians. His legacy is also mixed, as he is admired for his courage and patriotism, but criticized for his alliances with fascist powers.",

They looked like they’d each grown a foot since Tuesday, and it was a joyful reunion.\r\n\r\nFor the next hour, we had tacos and hung out, and then I shifted into Mom Mode™ and announced that it was time to turn off screens, take showers, and get ready for bed. We were all exhausted, and this scene ensued:\r\n\r\n“Can’t I just play video games?” asked one of them.\r\n“No, it’s time for bed,” I answered.\r\n“Come on, Mom, please?!!”\r\n“No, honey, it’s definitely bedtime.”\r\n\r\nAnd then came those dreaded words of an overtired preteen: “Ugh, Mom! I hate you!” and the bedroom door slammed.\r\n\r\nStanding there in the hallway, at first, I grouchily thought to myself, FINE! I do so much for you guys, and I left for only five nights so I wouldn’t be gone for too long, and I’m awake for you right now even though I’m jet-lagged and tired… I wanted to storm into my room and not say a word so he’d feel bad and have to come find me — a dramatic approach I might have done to a friend back in high school.",

Because not enough evidence existed to restrict use all together, it was and is still allowed in fruit-flavored beverages to this day. That may be changing soon, though.",

Moreover, they were able to adopt new trends and adapt to their readership.\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the secret formula to success? Here’s a short overview.\r\n\r\nHaving an engaged readership and an online community\r\nImagine having a very expensive car that runs on fuel but has no fuel tank.\r\n\r\nThat’s what a great blog would look like with no engaged readership. Your readers are the ones who drive the success of your blog by reading, commenting, sharing, and more.\r\n\r\nBeing active on social media\r\nConnect your blog to social media and post engaging content to attract new followers and readers.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be active on all media. Instead, try using analytics tools to see where your potential readers could be the most active. For example, photographer bloggers will focus on platforms such as Instagram.\r\n\r\nProperly selected niche\r\nIf you select a niche that’s not too broad or too narrow, you’ll be able to attract just the right amount of readers to whom you’ll be able to sell targeted products and services.\r\n\r\nPublishing consistently\r\nWith tens of thousands of blog posts published daily, your blog can fall into oblivion if you don’t update it regularly with fresh content. In fact, consistency is often a stumbling block for many new bloggers who want immediate fame and fortune.\r\n\r\nHaving a good blog design\r\nUnintuitive and cluttered design can become a real obstacle in attracting new visitors and readers. A strong design, on the other hand, will help you to gain trust as soon as someone lands on your blog.",
